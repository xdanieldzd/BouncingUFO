      "Hello and welcome to \u0022Bouncing UFO\u0022!",
      "In this game (if you want to call it that), you control a UFO on a mission on Earth, which has lost its cargo of, erm... \u0022biological material for research purposes\u0022. Yes.",
      "Your objective is to collect all the floating capsules of cargo around each stage. Not much of a difficult task, you think?",
      "Well, velocity and inertia on Earth are a b*tch, and your fancy spacecraft wasn\u0027t built for that stuff! Nor for slamming into earthly geology and structures for that matter, so watch for your shield energy!",
      "In short: Collect the capsules, be smart about accelerating and breaking. That\u0027s all there is to it! Which isn\u0027t much, I know, but eh, it\u0027s my first \u0022game\u0022 that went anywhere near this far, so I hope you\u0027ll enjoy it a bit regardless.",
      "Alright, that\u0027s about it, I\u0027ll leave you to the game, then! Have fun!"
